/**

 * This function is passed the coordinates of the player.  The function
 * also takes a direction that the player should move (UP, DOWN, LEFT,
 * RIGHT) defined in defines.h.
 * The coordinates are passed by reference so that they can be updated
 * by the function, while the return of the function is a status code.
 *
 * If the move is valid, the function must update map to move the player.
 * The old location of the player must be replaced by EMPTY and the new
 * location must be updated to hold PLAYER.
 * Also, if the move is valid, the function must update dot_map to remove
 * any DOT at the location where the player has moved and replace it with
 * EMPTY.
 *
 * If the player cannot move because it would run into a wall, the
 * function should return MOVED_WALL and not update the map, dot_map or the
 * coordinate pointers.  If the direction that was passed was not a
 * valid direction, the function should return MOVED_INVALID_DIRECTION.
 * If the function successfully moves the player, it should return
 * MOVED_OKAY.
 *
 * Preconditions: y and x must not be NULL
 * Postconditions: If the move is valid, y and x will be updated with
 *   the new coordinates, map and dot_map will be updated to remove dots
 *   at the old location, move the player, and replace its old location
 *   with EMPTY.  Returns MOVED_OKAY.
 *   If the move is invalid, none of those updates will occur and the the
 *   function will return the appropriate status code: MOVED_WALL or
